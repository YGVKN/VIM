We value and respect your privacy.  This "<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>" demonstrates our commitment to your right of privacy and explains how we use, disclose and protect the Personal Information (as defined below) of users ("<strong>you,</strong>" "<strong>User,</strong>" or "<strong>your</strong>") of the Website.
By visiting the Website, you expressly consent to the use and disclosure of your Personal Information as described below.  If you do not agree with the terms set out in this Privacy Policy, please do not visit the Website.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_information_do_we_collect"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_information_do_we_collect"></a>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person ("<strong>Personal Information</strong>").  We generally collect or receive Personal Information when you visit the ask.clojure.org domain on the Website in the following ways:
- when you voluntarily provide information to us, such as when you post questions, answers, or content on our forum or knowledgebase, or contact us;
- we collect information automatically through use of our Website; and
- other parties, such as GitHub, may provide information to us or grant us access to information which can be reasonably linked to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each of these methods is described in more detail below:
- Information You Voluntarily Choose to Provide
  - The Personal Information we collect from you will vary depending on the services you are using, parts of the Website you are visiting, and how you access those services and/or Website.  The Personal Information you provide to us may include any information you submit to us through email and post on our knowledgebase and forum.
  - You agree not to submit information that contain or reference, and understand and agree we have no obligations or liability with respect to: (i) information that can identify an individual in relation to any past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition, provision of health care, or payment for the provision of health care, including, but not limited to, diagnoses, treatment information, medical test results, and prescription information; and/or (ii) an individual’s race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, genetic data, biometric data, sex life or sexual orientation.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you acknowledge in no event will Cognitect be liable to you or any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, remote, cover, exemplary, consequential, special, or punitive damages, regardless of the foreseeability of such damages resulting from your submission of any such information.
- Information Collected Automatically When You Use the Website
Like most websites, we collect basic web traffic information (such as IP addresses) to monitor overall usage of our Website, understand Website traffic patterns, and identify if there are problems on the Website.
- Information We Receive from Others
In some cases, other parties provide us with Personal Information about you, or allow us to collect Personal Information about you.  Although we cannot control your privacy settings at those websites or how those other parties protect your privacy, once we receive information about you through those websites, we will treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
  - You may also be able to link an account from third-party websites, such as GitHub, to our Website.  This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign in to certain features on our Website.  If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
